### Area Light Sampling 
To reduce the amount of work in integrating the code, we implemented area light inside the shader only. By defining the metadata of area light directly inside the shader and combining with previous phong lighting code, we were able to achive the effect without having to pass any uniform from file `realtime.cpp`. In the `default.frag` shader code, the function `calculateAreaLightContribution()` performs area light sampling to compute the light contribution for a 3D scene. The sampling process is carried out over a grid defined on the area light. Initially, a variable `samples` is set to define the number of samples in each dimension, creating a `samples x samples` grid. Within nested loops, the code iterates over this grid. For each point (`i`, `j`) on the grid, normalized coordinates (`s`, `t`) are calculated to represent the position within the area light. These coordinates are then used to compute the exact 3D position of each sample on the area light's surface, taking into account the light's position, size (width and height), and orientation vectors (right and up directions). This sampling approach allows simulating soft shadows and the gradual fall-off of light intensity over the area of the light source.
